# Test My Code server #

*Test My Code* is a tool to automate some of the exercise checking when teaching programming. It runs code submitted by students, gives feedback if tests fail and stores points received for successful submissions. This allows for lots of small exercises without the need for course instructors to manually go through all of them.

The project is currently undergoing finishing touches to be ready for the Autumn semester. Instructions for setup and use will appear here soon.
